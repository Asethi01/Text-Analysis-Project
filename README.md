# Text-Analysis-Project
 
Please read the [instructions](instructions.md).
### Project Overview 
In this project, I have used two different data sources. I have used the Gutenberg library and I have also used 
Wikipedia as a source. I used the Gutenberg texts to carryout the normal processes like processing the file, removing stop words 
and find the most common words. I used the Babson and Bentley wikipedia pages to check their cosine similarity and plot it using MDS. 
I decided to not use the Gutenberg texts because they did not have much similarity between them. During this project I was hoping to learn 
more about python libraries and how we can use them to get information from the internet to make programs. I believe that I was able to 
accomplish my goal of learning more about different libraries. 

### Implementation
